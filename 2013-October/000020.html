<PRE>It is not maintainable having the syntax description in each and
every config. So we move it to a central location and just
reference to it (examples/README).

+# The config syntax is like this:

+#    The PID is searched by name with &quot;pidof -s&quot;.
+#
+###############################################################################
+#
+#    +++ Static memory +++:
+#
+#    &lt; Values + checks &gt;
+#
+#    Value:
+# ValName AbsAddress DataType [optional check] WishValue KeyBindings ActState
+#
+#    All addresses and offsets are in HEX starting with &quot;0x&quot; (e.g. 0xdeadbeef).
+#
+#    Possible DataTypes: i8, i16, i32, i64, u8, u16, u32, u64, f32, f64
+#
+#    checks: 'l' = &quot;less than&quot;, 'g' = &quot;greater than&quot;, '' = unchecked
+#
+#    Static wish values are in decimal (e.g. 42). But the dynamic wish values
+#    'min', 'max' and 'watch' are also possible. 'min' and 'max' start with 0
+#    and if the value gets less than min or greater than max, they are freezed
+#    at that value. This is good to find out the possible limits within the
+#    game. 'watch' makes KeyBindings and ActState useless. The line ends here
+#    then and the value is watched but never freezed. The last possibility is
+#    to use an absolute address or in dynamic memory an offset in the object
+#    (e.g. 0xdeadbeef). Then, the wish value is read from that location each
+#    time before checking and freezing it.
+#
+#    KeyBindings are alphanumeric chars [0-9a-zA-Z] separated by ','. These are
+#    processed by non-blocking getch and toggle the activation state at
+#    runtime. Multiple keys for the same value and multiple values for the same
+#    key are possible.
+#
+#    The activation state can be directly set to active ('a') or deactivated
+#    ('d') upon trainer start in the last colomn. Also watch ('w') is possible
+#    which results in ignoring the wish value and just displaying the current
+#    value. The difference here is that we can toggle the watching between on
+#    and off.
+#
+#    Check entry:
+# check AbsAddress DataType &lt;'l' or 'g'&gt; CheckValue
+#
+#    Checks are applied to the previously defined value entry.
+#
+###############################################################################
+#
+#    +++ Dynamic memory (e.g. C++ constructor) +++:
+#
+# dynmemstart ObjName ObjSize CodeJumpBackAddrOfMalloc OffsetOfCodeAddrOnStack
+#
+#    The object size is in decimal. The rest are addresses starting with &quot;0x&quot;.
+#    These come from the dynamic memory discovery (libmemdisc) or from the
+#    dynamic memory adaption.
+#
+# dynmemstack OffsetOfCodeAddrOnStack
+#
+#    Upto 8 stack offsets are possible. These are used when allocating objects
+#    from multiple code locations for multiple purposes (e.g. loading a Droid
+#    from a savegame and building a Droid in Warzone 2100). During adaption
+#    all these purposes have to be triggered for successful adaption.
+#
+# dynmemign OffsetOfCodeAddrOnStack
+#
+#    Like &quot;dynmemstack&quot; but ignored for regular use. This is for adaption
+#    only. An example is the Structure loading at mission start in Warzone
+#    2100. This is only used for opponents in single-player mode.
+#
+#    &lt; Values + checks like in static memory but with ObjOffset as Addr &gt;
+#
+#    Value:
+# ValName OffsInObj DataType [optional check] WishValue KeyBindings ActState
+#
+#    Check entries:
+# check OffsInObj DataType &lt;'l' or 'g'&gt; CheckValue
+#
+# checko OffsInObj DataType &lt;'l' or 'g'&gt; CheckValue
+#
+#    This is special. If this object check fails, it removes the object from
+#    the actively tracked object list like a free() would do. E.g. Warzone
+#    2100 uses the player ID in all objects. We don't want to make opponents
+#    immortal, so we check the player ID with this.
+#
+# dynmemend
+#
+#    Here, the memory class is closed. Static or dynamic memory can follow.
+#
+###############################################################################
+#
+#    +++ Dynamic memory adaption +++:
+#
+# adapt_script RelScriptPath
+#
+#    A script can be run if requested by ugtrain (-A) to automatically adapt
+#    the code address of a dynamic object in the config. Compilers and their
+#    options differ from distribution to distribution. Also the game version
+#    may differ. But if the object size is still the same, then there is a
+#    good chance to adapt by searching for the allocation in the disassembly.
+#    The path is relative to the config path.
+#
+# adapt_required 1
+#
+#    This is meant to ensure that the user is asked if he wants the automatic
+#    adaption to be run when he uses this config the first time. This is why
+#    this option is likely set in examples. It can be set to '0' afterwards.
+#
+###############################################################################
+#
+#    +++ Additional info +++
+#
+#    Dynamic memory always needs the preloader. Here, only the code address
+#    in the binary where &quot;malloc&quot; is called remains static. We have to find
+#    it and its locations on the stack with information from inside the game
+#    process.
+#    See linuxhooking/examples how to discover and adapt it to other versions.
+#
+#    Call the trainer first. Then, call the preloaded game in another terminal.
+#    Use the preloader for hooking libmemhack32/64.so into the game process.
+#    The trainer might require root permissions due to &quot;ptrace&quot; for a process
+#    in another process group.
+#    So it is better to let the trainer run the preloader with:
+#    &quot;ugtrain -P [lib] &lt;config&gt;&quot;.
