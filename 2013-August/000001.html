+# In the meanwhile there is a lot of automation and simplification implemented
+# so that the options -P and -D will help you with that. The option -P ensures
+# that ugtrain runs the game in the same process group. This way root is not
+# required any more. The libmemhack is automatically preloaded. With -D the
+# libmemdisc is preloaded instead and after recording the malloc calls it
+# searches for the found memory address from static memory search. This way
+# you get a list of all matching mallocs. Most of the time the last malloc
+# call is the correct one as interesting objects are kept until game end.
+#
+# There is also automatic adaption to game version/compiler/distribution
+# differences. Please have a look at the -A option. The examples will ask
+# you for automatic adaption the first time you run them. You should do
+# so and a shell script based on &quot;objdump -D&quot; and &quot;grep&quot; is called to find
+# the correct code addresses of your game. With that the discovery is run
+# to find the stack offsets. With everything adapted the game starts
+# automatically with the new config and it is written back to disk.
